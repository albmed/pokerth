GOAL 1
------

After a Private Message from Player X with text "create", "create step 1", or "create step1" create a BBC step 1 game, invite the player X. If player X joins the game, leave the game, so player X can be admin.
[ rather a proof-of-concept goal ]

GOAL 2
------

Create different type of games (step1-step4, monthly cup, heads-up) on command, load type of games and game settings from bbc website, only allow bbc admins to create games (depending on type).
 Reject any Invitation for BBC BOT

GOAL 3
------

[possible before goal 2]
bbcbot should auto-connect on startup and should close after connection or try to reconnect regularly
prevent disconnect due to inactivity
[so bbcbot can run 24-7]

GOAL 4
------

implement "ticket" command - it prints the tickets of a player
similar, implement a "rating" command
make a help command that points to a webpage


GOAL 5
------

implement more commands/features: 
[these are only ideas]
"joke" to tell a joke in lobby - like "fortune" for linux (make sure no caps and no offensive jokes)
"admins" - list admins and/or avaliable admins
"suggest step x" - suggest a player (among idle) to join the game
auto-greeting function of important bbc members
"king" (or "queen") - tells us the current step 4 winner
[some of these could increase the popularity of bbcbot among non-admins]


GOAL 6
------

report a BBC game on request for an admin
remember logfile links from non-admin (and make a copy)


GOAL 7
------

bbcbot can be used for authentification of bbc account

GOAL 8
------

make a PM-service (website to pokerth lobby), so you can reach players shortly after they joined the lobby

GOAL 9

help bbc admins with inviting based on bbc website
write warnings if bbc rules (e.g. tickets) are about to be violated
